# Hey, I'm Deniz 👋  

**Computer Engineering Student | Builder | Problem Solver**

I turn random ideas into real projects — from embedded systems to Flutter apps, from logic circuit simulators to crypto bots.  
If it sounds interesting, I’ll probably build it. If it sounds impossible… I’ll still try.

## 🔥 What I'm Working On  
- ⚡ Flutter apps (Firebase, Supabase, Gemini API)  
- 🎮 Logic Circuit Editor built with **Godot**  
- 🔧 Embedded C — bitwise ops, register-level programming  
- 🤖 Voice-based mini-assistant for kids  
- 📡 Networking experiments & protocol deep dives  
- 🧩 Side projects that fix real student-life problems
